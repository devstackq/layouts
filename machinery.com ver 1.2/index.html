									<span>Motorcycle  KTM 1290</span>
									<p>True adventure takes guts, so KTM’s rally experts brought out the big guns and packed 1.301cc, 140 Nm of torque and 160 hp into the world’s most advanced Travel Enduro chassis. This makes for a mile-munching omnivore, ready to carve its name into any terrain the tougher, the better.</p>

									<span>Chevrolet Bel Air</span>
									<p>This 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air hardtop is truly one of those no-compromises old cars. It's one of the most popular cars ever built and retains its awesome original look, stock 283, and factory suspension setup, so it drives and feels like a '57 should, not some modern hybrid. But it's also been upgraded with a few things that make motoring more pleasant if you're the kind of guy who hits the road on a moment's notice.  </p>

									<span> Dassault Mirage 2000D</span>
									<p>The airframe was strengthened for low-level flight and fitted with an Antilope 5 radar, which is used for terrain following, navigation and ground mapping, and which can follow terrain at 1,112 km/h (691 mph).[citation needed] Other avionic features are twin INS units and moving map displays for both the pilot and weapon systems officer. The Mirage 2000N can carry one ASMP medium-range nuclear missile, and can also carry two MATRA </p>

									<span>Ducatti X-Diavel</span>
									<p>It’s safe to say that “cruiser” isn’t exactly the first word that comes to mind when I think of Ducati, or even the third, yet here we are with the XDiavel and its slightly dressier, “S” trim package that carries the brand into uncharted waters. The “X” is meant to signify the cross and blending of the two worlds — cruiser and sport — and the end result is what the factory calls a “Techno-cruiser” due to its melding of Italian performance DNA and a more cruise-tastic rider triangle than you normally see from this brand. Powered by a 1,262 cc Testastretta engine, the XDiavel duo put the “sport” in “sport-cruiser” and opens the performance field to folks that ordinarily wouldn’t have such an option.</p>

									<span>aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov</span>
									<p>Kuznetsov—commissioned on Dec. 25, 1990—is an older ship, but the vessel’s age is not the real issue. There are a good number of U.S. Navy carriers that are far older than Kuznetsov that operate perfectly well. Nimitz, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Carl Vinson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln —are all older than the Russian ship. Moreover, USS Enterprise (CVN-65)—which was retired on Dec. 1, 2012, after more than 50 years in service—was just as ready to launch and recover aircraft on the day she was pulled out of service as she was the day she was first deployed in 1962.</p>

									<span>Topol-M</span>
									<p>The Topol-M is a cold-launched, three-stage, solid-propellant, silo-based or road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile.[2] The missile's length is 22.7 m and the first stage has a body diameter of 1.9 m. The mass at launch is 47,200 kg, including the 1,200 kg payload. Topol-M carries a single warhead with an 800 kt yield[1] but the design is compatible with MIRV warheads. According to chief designer Yury Solomonov, the missile can carry four to six warheads along with decoys.[11] Its minimum range is estimated to be 2,000 km and the maximum range 10,500 km. It has three solid rocket stages with inertial, autonomous flight control utilizing an onboard GLONASS receiver.[12] It is reputed to have the highest accuracy of any Russian ICBM[13] with a CEP of 200m.[14] The body of the rocket is made by winding carbon fiber.</p>

									<span>Bugatti Chiron</span>
									<p>
										The reason why this new Chiron isn’t worthy of the Super Sport name is because the drivetrain carries over mostly unchanged. The chassis features a number of upgrades, but the engine remains in stock form, so performance is pretty much the same. But Bugatti made developments in a department that needed serious improvements since the days of the Veyron: the handling. The Chiron Sport is a much more agile car, and it’s better suited for track use. It’s also a bit lighter than the standard model and comes with industry-first windscreen wipers made from carbon-fiber. Let’s find out more about all these enhancements in the review below.

									<p>	The CH-53 was the product of the US Marine Corps' "Heavy Helicopter Experimental" (HH(X)) competition begun in 1962. Sikorsky's S-65 was selected over Boeing Vertol's modified CH-47 Chinook version. The prototype YCH-53A first flew on 14 October 1964.[5] The helicopter was designated "CH-53A Sea Stallion" and delivery of production helicopters began in 1966.[6] The CH-53A is equipped with two of the T64-GE-6 turboshaft engine and has a maximum gross weight of 46,000 lb (20,865 kg).</p>
